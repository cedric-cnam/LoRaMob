# LoRaMob: An Open Dataset for Mobile LoRaWAN

This repository contains two datasets collected from emulated LoRaWAN networks: one spanning **11 days with ADR** and another covering **28 days without ADR**. 

The **full dataset** is hosted on **Nextcloud** due to its large size. In this repository, we provide a **3-day example dataset** and **scripts** to process and analyze the data.

## üìú Dataset Description

The dataset was generated using:
- Mobility data from **bike-sharing endpoints and travel times**.
- Emulation tools like **elora**, a LoRaWAN module for NS-3 designed for massive networks ([elora GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/elora)).
- Network and application servers implemented using **ChirpStack** ([chirpstack-docker](https://github.com/non-det-alle/chirpstack-docker.git)).

### Characteristics:
- Emulated for **4,000 devices** and **7 gateways**.
- Covers an area of **116.877 km¬≤**.
- Includes:
  - **11 days with ADR**: Emulated network behavior with ADR.
  - **28 days without ADR**: Emulated network behavior without ADR.
